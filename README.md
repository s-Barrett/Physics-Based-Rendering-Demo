# Physics-Based-Rendering-Demo

This project demonstrates a physics-based rendering (PBR) approach, developed during my university studies. It implements physics-based rendering equations in code to achieve more realistic lighting and material interactions.

## Features

- **Realistic Lighting Models**: Implementations of PBR equations to simulate light reflections, refractions, and shading.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: üñ•Ô∏è
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/s-Barrett/Physics-Based-Rendering-Demo.git

Run the project: üíΩ


Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
