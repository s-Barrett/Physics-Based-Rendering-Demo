# Physics-Based-Rendering-Demo
This project demonstrates a physics-based rendering (PBR) approach, developed during my university studies. It implements physics-based rendering equations in code to achieve more realistic lighting and material interactions.

## Project Status
- Status: **On Hold 🟡**
##

## Features

- **Realistic Lighting Models**: Implementations of PBR equations to simulate light reflections, refractions, and shading.
